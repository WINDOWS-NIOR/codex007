# Codex007 Demo Site

This repository contains a simple static website along with a lightweight Node.js server for local development.

## Structure

- `public/` – static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
- `server.js` – minimal server based on Node's `http` module
- `package.json` – npm configuration

## Usage

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed.
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The server will serve files from the `public` folder and can be customized as needed.
